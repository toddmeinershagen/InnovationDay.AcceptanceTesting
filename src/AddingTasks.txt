Feature: AddingTasks
	In order to keep track of my tasks
	As a todo list user
	I want to be able to add tasks

Scenario: Adding a task
	Given I am logged in with valid credentials
	| Field             | Value                    |
	| Username          | todd@meinershagen.net    |
	| EncryptedPassword | MEVj1+uV2rv+JAweOC1FOQ== |
	And I enter info for a new task
	| Field | Value                     |
	| Name  | Test Task                 |
	| Note  | This is a test task note. |
	When I save the task
	Then the task with title "Test Task" should appear in my list of tasks

        {
            this.Pause(200);
            var wait = new WebDriverWait(Session.Driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            Tag = wait.Until(driver => driver.GetElement(By.TagName("body")));
        }
