InnovationDay.AcceptanceTesting
===============================
This repository contains a presentation and the associated code that were delivered as part of an Innovation Day at MedAssets on September 25, 2014.  It is focused on the intersection between requirements and UI validation.  More specifically, SpecFlow and Bumblebee.Automation which is a layer on top of Selenium for web automation.
